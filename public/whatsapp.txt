[11/21/24, 9:27:05 PM] Nikhil Jain: yeah I imagine the EV stations might still be few and far apart there. kinda feels like an example of "top down" approach where a massive infrastructure investment needs to happen and only then can individual behavior adapt to it

[12/27/24, 1:51:35 PM] Nikhil Jain: like anything that happens late december until feb is somehow happening outside of normal reality and that makes it lighter and better

[12/27/24, 1:54:00 PM] Nikhil Jain: yeah I‚Äôm def in my zone around that time, but I also feel like few memorable things happen in that time

[12/27/24, 1:57:52 PM] Nikhil Jain: yeah tbd, being around so many weddings has its sway no doubt, but we‚Äôll see where the headspace is

[12/27/24, 2:06:54 PM] Atmika Pai: With amit, having kids was what led to break up right?
[12/27/24, 2:07:13 PM] Atmika Pai: He wanted to settle down too

[12/29/24, 12:23:57 AM] Nikhil Jain: and how was the evening
[12/29/24, 10:40:59 AM] Atmika Pai: It was good bittersweet
[12/29/24, 10:41:27 AM] Atmika Pai: Reflected on the break up, seems like we‚Äôre glad that it ended
[12/29/24, 10:41:40 AM] Atmika Pai: Chemistry still there which hurts a bit
[12/29/24, 10:41:57 AM] Atmika Pai: He‚Äôs still tryna move to nyc in the summer but no strings attached/expectations

[12/29/24, 10:42:16 AM] Atmika Pai: I literally cannot say no to him
[12/29/24, 11:43:14 AM] Nikhil Jain: ü•π just reading all of this tugged on my heartstrings
[12/29/24, 11:44:39 AM] Nikhil Jain: this is a movie moment, not a hallmark movie type but very realist
[12/29/24, 11:46:26 AM] Nikhil Jain: and I feel like this kind of post-hoc acceptance is a special kind of surrender
[12/29/24, 11:46:57 AM] Nikhil Jain: glad you got that closure <3
[12/29/24, 11:47:05 AM] Nikhil Jain: have you heard of the concept of the 3 people you fall in love with
[12/29/24, 11:49:47 AM] Nikhil Jain: it's from this white woman pop psych book, but tldr is you have 3 loves in your life that broadly map to 1. your first love (soulmate), 2. a very involved yet torrid partnership (karmic love), 3. your twin flame (someone with whom things just click right away without much pomp & circumstance, but feels right)
[12/29/24, 11:50:34 AM] Atmika Pai: Hmmm woke up today actually believing that im happy to be single. Bliss. Havent felt it before
[12/29/24, 11:50:53 AM] Atmika Pai: Hadnt heard of it so the last one is someone u settle down w
[12/29/24, 11:51:19 AM] Atmika Pai: The first one is unbelievable. So glad to have experienced it young.
Puts things into perspective
[12/29/24, 11:51:30 AM] Atmika Pai: I like that
[12/29/24, 11:51:37 AM] Nikhil Jain: omg that's big!!!!
[12/29/24, 11:52:08 AM] Nikhil Jain: special kinda contentment
[12/29/24, 11:52:35 AM] Nikhil Jain: and it sounds like it was a good first one, lasted much longer than most people's firsts too
[12/29/24, 11:53:04 AM] Atmika Pai: Hmmm have a good feeling abt 2025. Round number, divisible by 5
[12/29/24, 11:53:09 AM] Atmika Pai: Only looking up
[12/29/24, 11:53:18 AM] Nikhil Jain: NYE he's still around? doing your own thing?
[12/29/24, 11:53:33 AM] Nikhil Jain: and also square of 45
[12/29/24, 11:53:56 AM] Nikhil Jain: I love 9, so I love when numbers add up to 9
[12/29/24, 11:54:02 AM] Nikhil Jain: 2+0+2+5
[12/29/24, 11:54:07 AM] Atmika Pai: Yah met up w him day before yday and gonna meet w him today. He‚Äôs here for a week but my heart can only take couple meetings
[12/29/24, 11:54:50 AM] Atmika Pai: I smelled his scent the perfume he always wears and i was like this is precarious. Let‚Äôs take it one step at a time
[12/29/24, 11:54:57 AM] Atmika Pai: Pheromones lol
[12/29/24, 11:55:18 AM] Atmika Pai: Yess numerology surrendering to 2025
[12/29/24, 11:55:38 AM] Nikhil Jain: wait tmi question but do you like when you can smell a guy's scent
[12/29/24, 11:55:50 AM] Nikhil Jain: like not his cologne but his specific body smell
[12/29/24, 11:56:10 AM] Atmika Pai: 2024 was good too but felt like we were reconciling with events of yesteryear (pandemic, wars). Some of them still going on but 2025 seems hopeful
[12/29/24, 11:56:42 AM] Atmika Pai: Yesss i do. Noticed it recently. One of the guys i slept w, i remmeber thinking exactly that
[12/29/24, 11:56:49 AM] Atmika Pai: Do u
[12/29/24, 11:57:30 AM] Nikhil Jain: ya there's also some surrender in 2025 in my mind, like trump's coming in and part of me wants to just sit w my popcorn and see what plays out
[12/29/24, 11:57:58 AM] Atmika Pai: Ik ik there are some factors that could bring it all down
[12/29/24, 11:59:33 AM] Nikhil Jain: no but not in a bad way necessarily, more like trying the mindset of 'time to just stay in my line and take what I can to provide for me and my close ones'
[12/29/24, 11:59:36 AM] Nikhil Jain: does that make sense
[12/29/24, 11:59:54 AM] Nikhil Jain: literally the republican mindset almost ü§î
[12/29/24, 12:00:38 PM] Nikhil Jain: jk still keeping all my values intact, but yes curious to see what happens in 2025
[12/29/24, 12:00:56 PM] Nikhil Jain: ooooh yum

[12/29/24, 12:15:09 PM] Atmika Pai: Thats what he says. Focus on your projects mission loved ones. Love is a violet event, one can‚Äôt anticipate or seek it yk
[12/29/24, 12:15:45 PM] Atmika Pai: I cant wait to see u haha. Couple weeks to go
[12/29/24, 12:43:30 PM] Nikhil Jain: omg this was wave after wave of good, hard truths
[12/29/24, 12:45:31 PM] Nikhil Jain: yess and I agree w his finding that paradoxically love often comes when you're focusing efforts on developing yourself

[1/26/25, 5:28:16 PM] Atmika Pai: twas delish. We contemplated getting the old fashioned u recommended but sanjana n i r gonna run half marathon so not drinkin as much lollll
[1/26/25, 5:53:30 PM] Nikhil Jain: interestingg, I‚Äôve always seen allepey curry as more of a light yellow coconutty kind
[1/26/25, 5:53:48 PM] Nikhil Jain: omg when are you running a half marathon??
[1/26/25, 5:54:51 PM] Atmika Pai: March 30th philly, sanju convinced me hahaa
[1/26/25, 5:55:14 PM] Atmika Pai: Question for you - im debating between disc optimization for urban mobility and 3d interaxtion design
[1/26/25, 5:55:47 PM] Atmika Pai: The former is more relevant to what i wanna do in the future while the latter just seems like a fun and interesting class, stuff i prolly wont work w in the near term
[1/26/25, 5:55:56 PM] Atmika Pai: what u think i should do?
[1/26/25, 5:56:13 PM] Nikhil Jain: I‚Äôll come watch y‚Äôall run
[1/26/25, 5:56:18 PM] Atmika Pai: lfg
[1/26/25, 5:56:19 PM] Nikhil Jain: ooh that‚Äôs a tough one
[1/26/25, 5:56:40 PM] Atmika Pai: Make a poster
[1/26/25, 5:58:52 PM] Nikhil Jain: my first considerations would be: 
- which class will produce outputs that you can easily share in interviews, resumes, portfolio, etc in a way that you think will be impactful?
- ‚Å†which prof seems more connected to interesting opportunities, events, etc? (I‚Äôm gonna guess not prof lodi lol)
- ‚Å†which one seems like it could inspire a new interest that you‚Äôd want to get deeper into (eg algorithmic fairness if discopt, maybe 3d urban modeling tools if 3d interaction design)?
[1/26/25, 6:59:04 PM] Atmika Pai: hmm thought abt it. Prof Harold mentioned in class that he would help navigate career and I think that‚Äôll have more interesting proj for resume
[1/26/25, 6:59:17 PM] Atmika Pai: also for the last one, yah i think it has potential to inspire
[1/26/25, 6:59:25 PM] Atmika Pai: ok cool ty for the guiding questions
[1/26/25, 7:01:04 PM] Atmika Pai: i think i will still show up to disc optimization this week
[1/26/25, 7:27:55 PM] Nikhil Jain: ok yay see you bright and early in the morning then lol
[1/26/25, 7:28:39 PM] Nikhil Jain: I think I‚Äôll keep the class despite my grumbling, will let you know when there‚Äôs interesting lectures
[1/26/25, 8:21:58 PM] Atmika Pai: Haha no
[1/26/25, 8:22:02 PM] Atmika Pai: Ik u enjoyed it

[1/27/25, 10:59:08 AM] Atmika Pai: wow
[1/27/25, 10:59:31 AM] Atmika Pai: i was reading an rticle abt the ceasefire and the journalist mentioned trump‚Äôs take then musk‚Äôs take
[1/27/25, 11:01:17 AM] Atmika Pai: And i find that theyre often giving equal importance to musk. Like the article mentioned musk had a great convo with keir starmer pm of uk and they both support trump‚Äôs ceasefire. However, Musk doesn‚Äôt like Starmer cuz of the grooming gangs debacle
[1/27/25, 11:01:58 AM] Atmika Pai: So essentially yah
[1/27/25, 1:40:20 PM] Nikhil Jain: that‚Äôs insane, esp since musk is such a public figure already
[1/27/25, 1:40:54 PM] Nikhil Jain: I imagine other cases of presidential advisors / chiefs of staff / other influential people to the president are so much less public
[1/27/25, 2:29:57 PM] Atmika Pai: randian life now

[1/27/25, 3:18:12 PM] Nikhil Jain: corporate practices for large platforms like meta seem clear on how they‚Äôll respond to trump administration
[1/27/25, 3:18:46 PM] Nikhil Jain: but for saas companies like esri, there can be a big stake too ‚Äé<This message was edited>

[3/26/25, 7:16:55 PM] Nikhil Jain: It‚Äôs been a busy month for AI safety in NYC! Here‚Äôs a roundup of some March highlights and ongoing discussions for anyone in New York that‚Äôs working in, or curious about, this space:

üõü  All Tech Is Human hosted an important conversation about AI Companions ‚Äî the ChatGPTs, Claudes, and Character AI chatbots that sometimes become humanlike companions. We discussed the urgency to build the business case for AI safety interventions within organizations and the role of creative media (e.g., Her üé¨) in broader AI safety storytelling. More on the ongoing discussion at ATIH, including how to get involved in future events, here: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/all-tech-is-human_responsibletech-alltechishuman-activity-7306041884118822912-nWHp?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAABoxXkwBtTPYsS4s3OzFenUJ8G7Xirj23DA

üõü  Rishabh Surendran and Sally Gao hosted an inaugural AI Safety meetup the next day, bringing 35+ of us together across tech, government, and AI research labs to discuss current technical and policy approaches to AI safety. The next meetup will be in April. Give them a follow to stay in the loop! https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rishabhsurendran_midway-through-the-ai-governance-course-at-activity-7309410174404898816-Fa_i?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAABoxXkwBtTPYsS4s3OzFenUJ8G7Xirj23DA

üõü  Prof. Alexios Mantzarlis at Cornell Tech hosted AI Trust & Safety leaders Vinay Rao from Anthropic and Jerry Ruoti from Character.AI on Roosevelt Island last week in two seriously thought-provoking class lectures. Noteworthy themes included model misalignment, dual use AI systems, and red teaming. Besides directing Cornell Tech‚Äôs Security, Trust, and Safety initiatives and classes, Alexios also publishes some great newsletters on the topic and frequently shares opportunities related to T&S and AI Safety: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mantzarlis_lucky-to-have-two-digital-safety-veterans-activity-7308584735675482112-6Uky?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAABoxXkwBtTPYsS4s3OzFenUJ8G7Xirj23DA

Balancing innovation with safety was a discussion point at many other events in the city this month: Ethical AI Summit at NYU, Civic Tech‚Äôish Happy Hour, Oliver Haimson's Trans Technologies book launch, Decoded Futures demo day, and more. I‚Äôll be at more NYC events about AI safety, AI governance, and trust & safety in April. Reach out if you‚Äôre in this space too or looking to get involved!

[4/30/25, 1:09:26 AM] Atmika Pai: do u rly feel like youre creating anythign w these tools?
[4/30/25, 1:09:57 AM] Nikhil Jain: wdym
[4/30/25, 1:10:25 AM] Atmika Pai: Like the satisfaction that comes with creating or building something from scratch
[4/30/25, 1:10:38 AM] Atmika Pai: With ai, does it scratch the same itch?
[4/30/25, 1:10:53 AM] Atmika Pai: Or does it rob u off that feeling
[4/30/25, 1:11:17 AM] Nikhil Jain: ha I was very much having this same thought earlier
[4/30/25, 1:11:51 AM] Nikhil Jain: and my takeaway was that it feels like I‚Äôm mentoring and micro-managing an intern to finish a project that‚Äôs important to me
[4/30/25, 1:12:13 AM] Nikhil Jain: so even if I can be proud of the final output bc I ‚Äúmanaged‚Äù the intern well, I don‚Äôt get the satisfaction of having my own hands on it
[4/30/25, 1:12:29 AM] Nikhil Jain: and let me tell u this intern has been UNRULY today I almost yelled at it
[4/30/25, 1:12:37 AM] Atmika Pai: hahaha
[4/30/25, 1:13:00 AM] Atmika Pai: If only it could capture ur frustration
[4/30/25, 1:14:09 AM] Atmika Pai: yah just feels like we‚Äôre making more stuff to make more stuff. No deliberation
[4/30/25, 1:15:58 AM] Atmika Pai: But maybe there is a way to garner that satisfaction
[4/30/25, 1:16:21 AM] Nikhil Jain: for sure, it feels like this is all about scale
[4/30/25, 1:16:30 AM] Nikhil Jain: how much can we produce with how little time & effort
[4/30/25, 1:16:48 AM] Atmika Pai: Be satiated with ai. i dont want to be overly pessimistic
[4/30/25, 1:17:02 AM] Nikhil Jain: but in a way, it‚Äôs what gives me time to go have irl experiences instead of being at my screen hard coding / illustrating
[4/30/25, 1:17:37 AM] Atmika Pai: yahh that‚Äôs true
[4/30/25, 1:18:05 AM] Atmika Pai: Having an intern is nice to offload work lol
[4/30/25, 1:18:11 AM] Atmika Pai: Delegate
[4/30/25, 1:18:35 AM] Nikhil Jain: what‚Äôs crazy is I found myself feeling bad for like ‚Äúoverworking‚Äù  it
[4/30/25, 1:18:54 AM] Nikhil Jain: like I could almost feel its mental fatigue when it started to just get confused after too many directions
[4/30/25, 1:19:03 AM] Nikhil Jain: and I almost felt bad for it ya know

[5/3/25, 3:35:25 PM] Nikhil Jain: New York City is a world leader in publishing open datasets about all things urban. Following NYC Local Law 11 of 2012 (Open Data Law), all ‚Äúpublic‚Äù data used in city agencies is mandated to be made freely available on a single web portal. Today, the NYC Open Data portal contains 2600 datasets with millions of data points spanning topics like housing, health, transit, inspections, policing, and more. 10 years after the introduction of the Open Data Law and following the advancement and proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, the more recent Local Law 35 of 2022 now requires NYC agencies to annually report on their use of algorithmic tools, including descriptions of the tool‚Äôs use and purpose, datasets used, and vendor involvement. These algorithms assist agencies in significant decision-making processes, such as determining which public school a student applicant is matched to or how a defendant is prosecuted.

As New Yorkers, our involvement in NYC data and algorithms varies according to our demographic information, mobility patterns, health status, public benefits usage, and more. Learning which datasets we appear in and which algorithms are processing our information can help us stay informed about our digital profiles and rights. It is a first step towards educating and advocating for the ethical and responsible collection and processing of our information in public systems, which is a stepping stone towards influencing the much wider-reaching algorithms used in private systems (e.g., social media feeds, online shopping, dynamic pricing) as well as in public policymaking. By enabling New York City residents and visitors to personalize their understanding of how they may show up in NYC datasets and algorithms, we aim to empower them to:
     ‚Ä¢ Engage with the wealth of relevant information available on NYC Open Data
     ‚Ä¢ Learn how data-driven decisions are made in New York City operations, especially relevant to their unique circumstances
     ‚Ä¢ Understand the role of different stakeholders (e.g., policymakers, private vendors, academic institutions, public entities) in decisions
     ‚Ä¢ Challenge uses of data that may be biased or harmful
     ‚Ä¢ Influence the future design or procurement of algorithms in City agencies
     ‚Ä¢ Advocate for fairness and equity in broader information technology advancements, especially advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools

system concept - MakAR Lab is an augmented reality system purpose-built for the MakerLAB community at Cornell Tech, designed for seamless use with Meta Orion Smart Glasses. Targeting makers, like students or general neophytes, who have completed orientation but lack experience with advanced equipment, MakAR Lab serves as an always-available, personal guide to working with more advanced equipment. Users will wear the smart glasses to receive real-time, contextual, step-by-step instructions overlaid onto their view of the equipment. The system also includes an adaptive admin dashboard, empowering SuperMakers to upload and manage machinery protocols, streamlining day-to-day operations and enhancing oversight. We anticipate that this AR experience will offload some burden on in-person staff while supporting safe, independent operation. 
MakAR Lab‚Äôs core attraction is its unobtrusive, transparent interface, leveraging Orion‚Äôs wide field of view to minimize visual obstruction and cognitive load. The design vision is to instill confidence in new users on advanced machinery with simple, easy-to-follow guidelines, as posited by staff and Supermakers.
